    <h1>We are Hello Kittea</h1>

    <p>Our mission is to create high quality and fresh drinks for everyone.</p>
    <p>
      We constantly update our menu with new flavors and combinations, so that
      people have a chance to try something new every time they come in.
    </p>
    <p>
      We want to reduce as much waste as possible, so we use bio-degradable
      materials.
    </p>
    <p>
      Part of our proceeds go to non-profit organizations that clear the ocean
      of waste.
